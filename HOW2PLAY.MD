Read [Readme](README.md) first and ensure the mod is installed

## Matchmaking

Upon hiting the `play` button :

- Random matchmaking : Match against a random opponent

</p>

- Friendlies : Play against a private opponent by exchanging a join code

</p>

The join code is generated each time you are in friendlies mode. Use the `Copy your code` button to get the code.
The opponent has to enter the code in his friendlies tab

> [!WARNING]  
> Anyone with the code can join (hence why it's hided), so share with caution

> [!WARNING]  
> Watch out for Zero 0 and the letter O because for some reason they both have the same render ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Rules

The game is a first to 10 wins. Try to score more points than your opponent over all your hands. The game change a lot during this mode, below are the notables rules / change applied

</p>

The whole HUD changes to better fit the 1o1 mode:

- all of your cards are below (hand, jokers, deck and consumeables) ; in contrary, all of your opponent cards are at top
- below the red `Opponent VS Player` button, you can find your score and how much round you won, hands , discards and run infos ; top for the opponent
- the right part of the screen is the play area
- the number at up right is the timer (more info below)

## Give it all !

There is no ante , play all your hands and try to make more points than your opponent. The round is over when both player have no more hands

## Whatch out for the time !

To prevent the game from stalling, a timer is used to force an action when the countdown ends:

- Play a hand : 45 secs -> play a random card
- Cashout: 15 secs -> Cash out for you
- Shop : 60 secs -> End the shop , skip card if opened a booster

You can't also pause the game or use the original buttons to quit/change options etc...

## Interactions

To make the mods more fun and interactive, some additional 'disruptive' jokers and consumeables have been added. Their goal is to limit or hinder your opponent's play options.

> Potential balance changes may happen to them in the future.
